## 5.6.0 (2018-08-07)

- Added etcd checksum to support version 3.2.17.

## 5.5.1 (2018-07-18)

- Add default_service_name param for etcd_service resource. Now you can change service name from
  etcd_NODE_NAME(set false by default) to etcd(set true)

## 5.5.0 (2018-03-09)

- Convert from HWRPs to standard custom resources which resolves several incompatibilities that occured with the upcoming Chef 14 release

## 5.4.0 (2018-03-09)

- Make sure the service resource has a default action of :create
- Fixed handling of cert based auth
- Support storing data locally when using docker
- Wire-up service_timeout property to systemd timeoutstartsec
- Fix failing integration test
- Remove the ChefSpec matchers that are autogenerated now. If you see ChefSpec failures the fix is upgrading ChefDK.

## 5.3.1 (2018-01-28)

- Give etcd 120 seconds to start under systemd instead of the 60s default

## 5.3.0 (2018-01-13)

- Update the default etcd from 3.2.6 to 3.2.14
- Cleanup the test suites

## 5.2.1 (2017-12-02)

- Remove the start/wait logic from sys-v
- Fix checksum property on etcd_installation resource

## 5.2.0 (2017-09-11)

- Several changes have been made to the cookbook to better allow for building up new etcd clusters. Since etcd will loop waiting for quorum forever processes never hand control back to the init system when the first node is being built. To workaround this I have removed the healthcheck script that was previously bundled and added the ability to continue on after failures. To not fail when the service fails to start add ignore_failure true to the service_manager resource declaration (see the example in the readme) and Chef will continue allowing the cluster to complete its build out.
- Changed how the server_manager resources are declared to better support additional platforms that also use sys-v, upstart, or systemd. This gets us opensuse support, which is now part of the test matrix.
- Add docker testing to the test kitchen and remove the duplicate installation tests
- Fix new_resource error in the in etcd_service_manager_docker
- Resolve a deprecation warning in etcd_service_manager_docker
- Fix the etcd command to include the binary name in etcd_service_manage_docker

## 5.1.0 (2017-09-11)

- Be less specific in the service resources so we can support any platform that is systemd, upstart or sys-v
- Add that we support opensuse leap to the metadata / readme

## 5.0.0 (2017-09-05)

### Breaking Changes

- This cookbook has been refactored to work with etcd 3.X and now defaults to installing 3.2.6\. 2.x will not work as many new configuration properties have been added to etcd. If you need support for etcd 2.x you should pin the 4.X release of this cookbook.
- This cookbook now longer requires compat_resource and also utilizes the systemd_unit resource in Chef. Due to this the cookbook now requires Chef 12.11 or later.
- The execute provider for the etcd_service has been removed as Chef should not be used as an init system. There is now fully functional sys-v, upstart, and systemd support, which are preferred alternatives.

### Other Changes

- Listening ports in examples, tests, and resources have been updated for the new ports used by etcd
- Integration testing has been updated to InSpec
- The default path to the data dir is now an absolute path to resolve some previous issues
- All Chef 14 deprecation warnings have been resolved
- Remove the only_if on the service start that could potentially prevent the service from starting
- Sync up the unit file with the upstream format recommended by the project
- Fix faulty logfile logic in the upstart / sys-v scripts that prevented these resources from ever working
